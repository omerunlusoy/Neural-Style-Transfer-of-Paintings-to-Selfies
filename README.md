Style Transfer of selfies to paintings using Convolutional Neural Networks

Style transfer is a method of applying the features of one input image (photo, painting, etc.) which is called Content Image onto another input image, Style Image, to produce an output image, Target Image, with the content of one and the style of the other.

Style Transfer is a well-known and common practice in Machine Learning and the most simple versions can be used to teach the fundamentals of it.

This project uses Convolutional Neural Networks (VGG-19) for the style transfer implementation.

The project transferred styles of famous paintings onto photographs in the form of portraits and selfies, especially focusing on the selection of certain Artists such as Van Gogh, Francisco Goya, El Greco, etc.

Several example runs can be seen in the example-runs folder.
