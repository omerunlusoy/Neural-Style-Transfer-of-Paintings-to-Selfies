Style Transfer:

- Image Content, Image Style
- The aim of Style Transfer is to combine contents of a given image with the style of the completely different image.
- We will accept human portraits or selfies and transform thier style to different paintings.
- Different Painting Styles such as Modernism, Impressionism, Expressionism can be used for the new style of input image. 
	- (http://www.kokuyocamlin.com/blog/world-art-day-understanding-different-painting-styles-part-1.html)

- Input Image (Image Content) + Style Image (Image Style) -> Target Image

- core content of the input image stays the same while its style is completely different.
- can use CNNs
- can use Transfer Learning (pre-trained models), (VGG-19 model can be used since it has enough complexity for this task)
	- 16 Convolutional layers + 3 Fully connected layers + 5 Max Pooling layers

- no analyzes (no accuracy or any other metrics)
- Style Transfer can be done using mainly feature extraction from standard CNNs.
	- These features will be manipulated to extract style or content information (2 Gram Matricies will be matched).

- PyTorch package will be used.
- CUDA can be used to speed the process up.
